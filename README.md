Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
DEFINITION  : It is the systematic application of engineering principles,methodologies and tools to developing and mantaining software systems.
IMPORTANCE  : It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of our daily modern lives.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The establishment of Software engineering in the 1960's
The development of proogramming languages (in 1957 Fortran was created)
The arrival of structured programming in the 1970's


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements  : Collecting and documenting user needs as well as system requirements.
Design        : Creating high-level detailed designs for the user interface as well as the sotfware architecture.
Implementation: Writing code to build the software according to the design specifications.
Testing       : Running various tests to ensure that the software meets the quality standards and functionality requirements
Deployment    : Releasing the software to users or customers
Maintenance   : Providing ongoing software support,updates and enhancemence after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL    : Sequential approach with distinct steps flowing down like a waterfall
EXAMPLE      : it can be used while developing a mobile application using the software development life cycle from beging to deployment and beyond. 
AGILE        : Frequentantive and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
EXAMPLE      :  It can be used when a team is undertaking to improve an existing software product so that it can compete with its competitors relying on cusomer feedback and the likes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER  :   Is responsible for writing code and iplementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer  : Designs and executes test plans to ensure the software quality meets the standard.
PROJECT MANAGER     : Oversees the planning, execution and deelivery of the software project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's  : Sofftware suites that provide comprehensive tools for coding, debugging and testing code e.g Visual studio, Eclipse, ItelliJ IDEA
VCS    : software tool for tracking changes to source code e.g Git, subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements  : Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines        : Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can lead to rushed development and compromised Quality.
Techical Debt          : tehcnical debt accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions can impede future development efforts and increase matainence costs

STRATEGIES  : Effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritisation of tasks and regular reassesment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT          : Testing a singular/individual components or modules of software
INTERGRATION  : Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
SYSTEM        : Testing the entire software System as a whole
ACCEPTANCE    : Testing software agains user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

IMPORTANCE  : Quality control measures help identify and fix defects early in the development process,, leading to higher quality software products. Measures such as code reviews, automated testing and continuous intergration.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is a starting point that is yet to generate a natural language response from a language model.
it is important because it helps us craft Promts in a way that we can get the best responses


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
VAGUE PROMPT      : Please give me a chocolate reciipe
CORRECTED PROMPT  : Please give me a chocolate brownie cake recipe and mixing method.
